# Hangman Game

This is a Hangman game project built using React.

## Description

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Each incorrect guess results in the drawing of a body part of a hanging man. The objective is to guess the word before the entire man is drawn.

This project is implemented using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes React's component-based architecture to create reusable and modular components for different parts of the game.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words.
- Displays the hangman figure and the word to be guessed.
- Allows the player to input letters and checks if they are present in the word.
- Keeps track of the number of incorrect guesses and updates the hangman figure accordingly.
- Notifies the player when they win or lose the game.
- Provides an option to restart the game.
